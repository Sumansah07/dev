   <h1> Learn Back-end Languages</h1>
  
    </div> 
<p>Learning back-end languages is the second important step you need to take to become a full stack developer in Nepal.Back-end languages are used in the function of the backend of a web application including database operations, logical operations, and user validation.</p>

<p>The following are some essential back-end languages you will need to learn to become a professional full stack developer.</p>
</p>
<p>
    PHP: PHP serves as a great option for beginners to learn back-end language. This programming language is easy, powerful, and more tolerant of errors.</p>

<p>
    Ruby: Ruby is an open-source back-end language using which you can create basic tasks. It consists of an incredible array of frameworks and libraries.</p>
</p>
<p>
    Python: Python is a very accessible programming language and it is used to create small and large projects. Python is an object-oriented open-source language and it has heavy community involvement across various levels.</p>
</p>
<p>
    Learn JavaScript
    JavaScript is a must-learn for a full stack developer. JavaScript is a powerful and easy-to-use programming language which is used in both front-end and back-end processes to manipulate and validate data. JavaScript can be used to update CSS and HTML as well.</p>
</p>
<p>
    Database Management
    Every software needs databases to store its data to make it easy for developers to access them later. Thus, understanding the manipulation of databases is necessary for a full-stack developer in Nepal. A full-stack developer must have the knowledge of refined database management and relational databases.</p>
</p>
<p>
    These are some commonly used databases in the full stack development:

</p>
<p>
    HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a client-server protocol which is used for data exchange and fetching resources like HTML documents. It makes it simple and extendible to improve the overall performance of the application. Meanwhile, REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an interface that provides flexibility to developers to collect data without compromising the application’s stability.</p>
</p>

    <p>
        Sourcetree and Git
        A version control system aka source control system is a software tool used to track and manage the changes made to the software codes. Version control systems like Git allows developers to supervise all the modifications made to source code in a faster and smarter way.</p>
